This repository has a Python Version of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) project that is under development.

The goal of the overall project is to have some RL agent(s) learn to play a game in a cellular automata (CA) environment. The game should also be playable by humans in manual mode, and this may also help collect training data for Supervised Learning pre-training of Neural Network weights.

This project, and the RL training involved, is eventually meant to engage users, be visual, and be part of a distributed machine learning project. That's why it was originally being developed in a website. And to make the RL in the project part of a truly 'distributed' study, we were using client-side computation with TensorFlow.js.Tensorflow.js will be used in the final implementation of this project, but in the current phase, the exploratory phase of just trying to nail down the game details and get RL to work, Python will be the language used. This repo is the source of the ideas being explored.

"Pattern" Game🪄䷷

Goal: Draw/generate a state/pattern on the board (starting from a blank cellular automaton canvas). 
For instance, show player/agent the picture of the pattern generated by F, (right), (up), F, F, F, F, F in the Game of Life. (see pic below)
See if they can figure out the key commands to get this state.

Game Dev Notes: These games should be easy to generate (and filter to interesting pictures (i.e.not blank) if not done randomly like our current implementation) but likely tough to solve.

Start with simple patterns, like a 2x2 block which just corresponds to a single "F" the hex command which translates to a 2x2 1111 block. Build to more complex.

Game Play Note: The website has a UI for drawing 2x2 blocks, but it seems like key strokes could be a better way of inputting values... it feels more like a coded spell than clicking a UI.

Another Practical Approach to help RL learning that may be needed:
Log human play -> Supervised Learning Weight Initialization (mimic human actions) -> Final stage of RL 
(Like Alpha Go approach of training on top Go players before progressing to RL phase)

# Command Line Tool for RL Training & Demos


# Pattern builder (for 'pattern' game) (creates custom_pattern .npy file)
uv run rl_ca.py create_pattern

# Manual play (records optional data) 
uv run rl_ca.py manual --reward pattern --pattern-file custom_pattern_12x12.npy --steps 500

#  - Press 'r' to start recording, 'r' to stop
#  - Control with arrow keys / hex keys
#  - Press 'p' to save immediately, or recording auto-saves on exit

## Code Developed At Recurse Center
The Recurse Center asks participants to program at the edge of their ability...

“The Edge... There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others-the living-are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between Now and Later. But the edge is still Out there.”
