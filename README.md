Reinforcement Learning excerpt from

ToDo: 
1) Remove CriticPattern Network to start.
The action to write should be made to flip (not write) one bit. 
The agent is 1x1 not 3x3.
2) Fix code; make Actor-Critic sound
3) Practical approach:
Log human play -> Supervised Weight Init. from human play -> RL (Like Alpha Go approach)

The Recurse Center asks us to program at the edge...

“The Edge... There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others-the living-are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between Now and Later. But the edge is still Out there.”
